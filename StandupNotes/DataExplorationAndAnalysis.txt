General Idea
==========================================================================================
-- The dataset comprises of 2D images that are electron microscopy of drosophila eyes.
-- The images are captured at various growth stages of the eyes.
-- In this project, we mainly concentrate on studying the growth of rhabdomeres in the eyes.
-- These are called photoreceptors helpful in light gathering.


Dataset
==========================================================================================
-- The images are of very high resolution and resulted in large size.
-- We are taking a part(31 images) of the total samples present in the dataset for the initial phase.
-- We are reading the images in grayscale format.
-- Every image is of size 6144 X 4096 pixels.
-- In every image, the pixel values range from 0 to 65520.
-- So, to represent each pixel in an image, we need 16 bits, that gives the maximum value of 65535.
-- So, the bit depth of the image is of 16 bits.


Idea for pre-processing stage
==========================================================================================
-- As the images are of high resolution, we need to find a technique to represent the same image that occupies less size without loosing the integrity of the image.
-- This can be achieved by a technique called Normalization.
-- Using, Normalization, we can confise the range of pixel values from a range of {0 to 65520} to a range of {0 to 255}.
-- This results in a bit depth of 8 bits.
-- This helps using optimized space and can speed up the performance of operations.


Current pre-processing stage
==========================================================================================
-- In the current pre-processing stage, we take the original image, crop the image to a size of 1500 X 500 pixels.
-- Then we apply normalization using Min-Max normalization technique to the cropped image.


Updated pre-processing stage
==========================================================================================
-- In the updated pre-processing stage, we initially take the original image, apply normalization technique to the entire image.
-- Then we crop the normalized image to 1536 X 1024 pixels (quarter of the original shape) and the cropped image is taken at the center of the original image. 

-- The main reason of applying normalization technique before cropping the image, when the normalization is applied, we take the maximum value of the pixels present in the region or entire image, if we apply normalization to the cropped region, the maximum value in the cropped region may not be equal to the maximum pixel value of the entire region.
-- So, in the final step, if we move from cropped region to the entire image, we can observe the change in pixel values in the cropped region as the maximum pixel value is changed.
