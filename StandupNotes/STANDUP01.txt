# STANDUP 01 Ð 2/10/2023 TEAM FlyEMGeneral Update and Intro============================Teams assembled and introducedSelected Project Leaders: Sai Harshavardhan Reddy Kona & Nikhila Yadav LankelaTalked to TA and discussed about the current project status and the tasks needs to be doneVoted to use GitHub Issues to keep track of Working Packages/TasksCreated GitHub repo: https://github.com/kshvr16/CS410_FlyEMDraft of Requirements=========================Outcome: To build a software that detects hexagonal photoreceptors in fly retina. The software needs to have the following functionalities:* Removes noise if any* Tries to adjust the contrast level of input images.* A segmentation pipeline that perform segmentation of images.* Detects hexagonal photoreceptors in the image.We propose the following technologies for the software:* Jupyter notebook: Coding environment* Python: Programming language for implementation* OpenCV: To manipulate images and perform traditional computer vision algorithms* Keras: To implement neural networksCurrent Questions / Problems / Something you need=====================================================* We need to understand previous techniques used and previous results.* We need to know if the data will be updated from time to time* We need to discuss with TA about exploring traditional CV algorithms and ANN models for detection techniques.List of Working Packages with responsible Student and Completion Dates========================================================================* Explore Image dataset [Nikhila Yadav Lankela] by 2/15* Understand previous techniques, implementation, results [Sai Harahavardhan Kona] by 2/15* Explore Noise Removal Techniques and Contrast adjustments [Varshitha Hantur Dinakar + Varuni Manjunath] by 2/15
