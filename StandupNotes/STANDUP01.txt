# STANDUP 01 √ê 2/10/2023 TEAM FlyEM


General Update and Intro
============================
* Team assembled and introduced
* All Team members: Sai Harshavardhan Reddy Kona, Varshitha Hantur Dinakar, Nikhila Yadav Lankela, Varuni Manjunath
* Selected Project Leaders: Sai Harshavardhan Reddy Kona and Nikhila Yadav Lankela
* Talked to TA and discussed about the current project status and the tasks needs to be done
* Agreed to use Jupyter notebook as environment setup for implementation
* Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/kshvr16/CS410_FlyEM


Draft of Requirements
=========================
Outcome: To build a software that detects hexagonal photoreceptors in fly retina. 

The software needs to have the following functionalities:
* Removes noise if any
* Tries to adjust the contrast level of input images.
* A segmentation pipeline that perform segmentation of images.
* Detects hexagonal photoreceptors in the image.

We propose the following technologies for the software:
* Jupyter notebook: Coding environment
* Python: Programming language for implementation
* OpenCV: To manipulate images and perform traditional computer vision algorithms
* Keras: To implement neural networks


Current Questions / Problems / Something you need
=====================================================
* We need to understand previous techniques used and previous results.
* We need to know if the data will be updated from time to time
* We need to discuss with TA about exploring traditional CV algorithms and ANN models for detection techniques.
